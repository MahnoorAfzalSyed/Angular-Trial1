# Angular Trial App

This is my first Angular project, built by following a [TinyMCE blog tutorial](https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/create-new-angular-project/). I'm using this project as a starting point for practicing Angular development, and I plan to create more projects as I learn.

## Features
- Rich text editor using TinyMCE
- Custom components for input fields and send button
- LESS-based styling

## Getting Started
To run this project:
```bash
npm install
ng serve
