Introduction
This is a basic Angular messaging interface built using Angular and TinyMCE. I created this project in July 2025 by following a tutorial from TinyMCEâ€™s blog (https://www.tiny.cloud/blog/create-new-angular-project/) as my first step into Angular development. My goal was to get hands-on experience with Angular components, reactive forms using signals, and integrating third-party libraries like TinyMCE. This project marks the beginning of my Angular journey, and I plan to build many more apps to grow my skills.

Tech Stack
- Angular CLI v20.0.5
- TinyMCE Editor (via @tinymce/tinymce-angular)
